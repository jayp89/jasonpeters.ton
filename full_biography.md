## **Early Life and Personal Background**

Jason Aaron Peters was born in 1989 in Durban, a coastal city in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, to Mark Giles Peters and Jill Diane Peters (née Holme). While his roots are in South Africa, his identity and professional trajectory were profoundly shaped by his upbringing in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

A long-term resident of Ethiopia for over 26 years, this cross-cultural experience provided him with a unique perspective, blending an external viewpoint with a deep, nuanced understanding of Ethiopian society. A foundational element of his professional identity is his deep cultural and linguistic integration, most evident in his fluency in Amharic. An interview with Addis out Media highlighted this, describing him as speaking the language "fluently" (using the Amharic phrase "ቅርጥፍጥፍ አርጓቷል," which conveys a high degree of natural proficiency).

This personal history is a cornerstone of his business strategy, allowing him to communicate complex technical concepts directly in Amharic and bypass cultural barriers. From an early age, Peters developed a keen interest in computers, specifically in foundational architecture and network infrastructure. This early focus on systemic thinking laid the groundwork for his future approach of building entire business ecosystems.

## **Early Career: Foundations in Media and Management (2008–2015)**

Peters' early professional life was characterized by demanding roles in management and media that collectively built his skills in business operations and public engagement.

His first major leadership role was as General Manager of **Peters Industrial Enterprises PLC** from 2008 to 2013\. Immersed in the challenges of the industrial sector, his underlying passion for technology was evident. In 2011, he responded to a public call for the "Ubuntu Global Jam," confirming, "We Peters Industrial Enterprises PLC will be hosting the Ethiopian Jam." This action revealed his early efforts to cultivate a grassroots tech culture in Addis Ababa.

Concurrently, he embarked on a career that would define his public identity, joining **105.3 Afro FM** in June 2009\. Over a six-year tenure, he held various roles, including presenter and producer, ultimately ascending to Program Manager. His time at Afro FM was a strategic immersion into the key demographic of tech early adopters. It was here that "JayP" became a recognized voice, building the public trust he would later leverage. Evidence also suggests he may have hosted "Rock 101 With Jason," described as "ETHIOPIA'S FIRST AND ONLY ROCK SHOW," indicating a long-term passion for broadcasting.

Further diversifying his skill set, Peters served as Manager at the **Addis Regency Hotel** from 2011 to 2012, sharpening his abilities in operational logistics and customer service.

## **Mastering Marketing and Advertising (2013–2021)**

For eight years, Peters served as General Partner and Marketing Director at **Bunifu Advertising**, a firm described as "Ethiopia's leading Creative Communications Team." This role was a crucial phase, providing the strategic framework to connect his content creation abilities with sustainable business models.

Operating in media (Afro FM until 2015\) and advertising simultaneously, he created a professional feedback loop. He translated his practical understanding of audience engagement from radio into the commercial realm, developing brand strategies for businesses. This period honed his ability to think of content as a strategic asset and provided the final foundational piece before launching his own large-scale, tech-focused enterprises.

## **The Digital Vanguard: Building the "ETHIO TECH" Media Ecosystem**

In 2019, Peters launched the most public-facing phase of his career, centered around the "ETHIO TECH" brand.

### **"ETHIO TECH with JayP" YouTube Channel**

The flagship of this ecosystem is the YouTube channel **ETHIO TECH with JayP**, founded in December 2019\. The channel is explicitly branded in Amharic as "የኢትዮጵያ ቁጥር 1 የቴክኖሎጂ ቻናል" ("Ethiopia's number 1 technology channel"). As the sole creative force, JayP researches, edits, and presents all content, which ranges from tech reviews (e.g., Samsung Galaxy A12), and hardware projects (e.g., Raspberry Pi Zero W) to tutorials on digital marketing and making money online.

Analysis of the channel's content reveals a strategic evolution. While founded on general technology, its most popular and recent videos are heavily concentrated in FinTech, particularly cryptocurrency. Videos analyzing crypto-gaming platforms like Hamster Kombat have garnered exceptionally high view counts. This shift reflects a response to clear market demand, serving the dual purpose of capturing a highly motivated audience and cultivating a community receptive to his own FinTech ventures.

### **"CYBER Ethiopia" Podcast and Broadcast**

Complementing his YouTube presence, Peters hosts **CYBER Ethiopia**, a technology-focused podcast. The show is distributed on major platforms (Apple Podcasts, Spotify) and, significantly, is also broadcast as an "English Tech news Update" every Monday on **104.7 EBC radio**, a major state-affiliated broadcast outlet. This hybrid digital and traditional broadcast strategy allows him to reach diverse demographics, from digitally-native youth to a broader audience that relies on traditional radio.

### **"ETHIO TECH NEWS"**

In September 2021, Peters expanded his media presence by launching **ETHIO TECH NEWS**, assuming the role of Editor-in-Chief. This move elevated him from a content creator to a formal journalistic figure, further solidifying his brand's authority as a definitive source for industry developments.

### **An Integrated Business Model**

Peters has engineered a powerful, self-reinforcing cycle where his media influence directly drives technology adoption:

1. **Audience Education:** He uses his media platforms to educate his large Ethiopian audience on complex topics, building trust.  
2. **Product Introduction:** He introduces his own localized products (like The ETN Ecosystem) as superior, locally relevant alternatives.  
3. **Community Funneling:** He directs his media audience to dedicated community channels (primarily Telegram) to encourage direct participation and adoption.  
4. **Content Reinforcement:** The progress and successes within his ventures become new content for his media channels, serving as social proof and attracting new users into the funnel.

## **Entrepreneurial Ventures: Pioneering Ethiopian Technology**

In parallel with his media empire, Peters has launched a portfolio of ambitious, tech-focused companies.

### **Ethio Tech AI and Maqdala-AI**

In December 2019, Peters founded **Ethio Tech AI**, recognized as Ethiopia's first artificial intelligence organization, predating the establishment of the national Ethiopian Artificial Intelligence Institute. The company's foundation was driven by what Peters described as outrage at the initial global launch of ChatGPT, which excluded Ethiopia and other African nations from creating accounts.

Viewing this regional lockout as a form of "technological fascism," Peters and a small group of engineers embarked on a workaround. They utilized thousands of temporary numbers from Western countries to create over 1,000 ChatGPT accounts. With the combined $20 sign-up credit from each account, they built a front-end, initially called ETHIO TECH GPT and later Magdala AI.

This initial version was massively successful, amassing over 100,000 daily active users at its peak. When the API credits were exhausted, the team realized they possessed a highly valuable asset: a large database of user questions and model answers. This database provided more than sufficient training data, which was subsequently used on Google's Vertex AI to build the proprietary, second-generation model that is today known as **Maqdala-AI**.

The company's flagship project, Maqdala-AI, is now a pioneering Large Language Model (LLM) focused on Ethiopian languages, marketed as a superior, locally-focused alternative "Advanced beyond ChatGPT" for Amharic and Afan Oromo.

The choice of the name "Maqdala" is a powerful act of cultural branding. Maqdala was the 19th-century mountain fortress of Emperor Tewodros II. Its siege by the British in 1868 and the subsequent looting of thousands of sacred manuscripts represent a profound cultural loss—a historical "data breach" of Ethiopian knowledge. By naming his Ethiopian-language LLM "Maqdala-AI," Peters frames its creation as the rebuilding of a national fortress of knowledge in the digital realm, a symbolic reclamation of cultural and digital sovereignty.

### **Ge'ez eSport**

In October 2020, Peters co-founded **Ge'ez eSport**, serving as a Founding Member and Chief Technology Officer (CTO). The company enters a rapidly expanding Ethiopian gaming market. The branding is another example of cultural embedding. "Ge'ez" is the ancient liturgical language of Ethiopia, the foundation for Amharic and Tigrinya. By naming an eSports venture after Ge'ez, Peters imbues the modern world of competitive gaming with a sense of ancient heritage and national prestige.

### **The ETN Ecosystem**

Peters' most ambitious venture is **The ETN Ecosystem**, a decentralized platform he founded on The Open Network (TON) blockchain. (This project is entirely distinct from the global cryptocurrency Electroneum, ETN).

The project is a micro-economy experiment designed to create real-world applications for digital currencies in Africa. Its identity is rooted in the Amharic word **"Netsa" (ነፃ)**, meaning "free" or "liberation," encapsulating the core tenet of empowerment. The ecosystem is centered around the **ET NETSA Coin ($ETN)** and a suite of "ET Netsa Apps™".

The choice of the TON blockchain is strategic, leveraging its low fees and integration with the Telegram messaging app, which has massive user penetration in Ethiopia. To foster engagement, the ecosystem launched an innovative, Ethiopian-themed Telegram airdrop game where players collect digital coins while avoiding the "Jebena," the traditional clay coffee pot.

#### **Platforms within The ETN Ecosystem**

The ecosystem has an ambitious roadmap of 17-27 distinct services, including:

| Platform/Utility | Description/Purpose |

| **NetsaAI** | A Telegram AI bot creator allowing developers to accept $ETN. |
| **ETN Authenticator** | An OTP and 2FA system for securing ecosystem applications. |

#### **ET Netsa Coin ($ETN) Tokenomics**

The project's whitepaper details the financial architecture of the $ETN token, which is capped at a total supply of 5 million.

| Metric | Value / Allocation | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Total Supply** | 5,000,000 $ETN | The maximum number of tokens that will ever be created. |
| **Airdrop Allocation** | 1,000,000 $ETN (20%) | Distributed to community members to encourage adoption. |
| **Liquidity Pool (LP)** | 2,000,000 $ETN (40%) | Paired with TON to ensure liquidity on decentralized exchanges. |
| **Initial LP Pairing** | 2,000,000 $ETN with 200 TON | Establishes the initial trading price and market liquidity. |
| **Initial Valuation** | 1 $ETN \= 0.0001 TON | The calculated starting price based on the liquidity pool pairing. |

#### **Strategic Analysis: The 'Cultural Moat' Model**

The broader ecosystem leverages Peters' media expertise, including an online radio station called "ETN-FM" (currently in test broadcast) and a comprehensive documentation website hosted on GitHub to support its community.²⁶

Across Maqdala-AI, Ge'ez eSport, and The ETN Ecosystem, a clear and powerful strategic pattern emerges. Peters is not merely building technology companies; he is constructing "cultural moats" around his ventures. By deeply integrating his products with foundational elements of Ethiopian history (Maqdala), ancient language (Ge'ez), and daily cultural traditions (the Jebena), he creates brands that are authentic, relatable, and difficult for non-local competitors to replicate. This strategy fosters a strong sense of community ownership and national pride, encouraging adoption by connecting with users on an emotional and cultural level, not just a functional one.

## **Public Profile and Enduring Influence**

Through his consistent and highly visible work across multiple platforms, Jason "JayP" Peters has cultivated a significant public profile, becoming one of Ethiopia's most recognized and trusted commentators on technology. His influence extends from social media and online platforms to national broadcast television, cementing his status as a key figure in shaping public discourse around the country's digital future.

His expertise is sought by mainstream media outlets, as evidenced by his appearances on national broadcasts to provide insight on technological developments. A YouTube short titled "Jason Peters Shocks Everyone in His Explosive Interview with ETV about ChatGPT\!" points to his engagement with high-profile media channels like the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation (ETV) on timely and critical tech topics.⁹ These appearances grant him a level of authority and reach that extends far beyond his own online channels.

This authority is also recognized within the tech industry itself. Shega.co, a leading Ethiopian technology news and analysis platform, identified Peters as a key online personality who has "acquired significant engagement and authority" on trending topics like the "Hamster Kombat" Telegram game, highlighting his role as a trusted source for understanding new digital phenomena.¹¹ This external validation from a respected industry publication serves as a critical indicator of his influence among his peers and within the broader tech ecosystem.

His public-facing brand is further amplified by a well-maintained and extensive digital footprint across numerous social media platforms. He actively engages with his community through a suite of channels linked to his ETHIO TECH brand, ensuring his message is accessible to a wide range of demographics. His official social media presence includes:

* **Twitter (X):** twitter.com/jason\_peters1  
* **TikTok:** tiktok.com/@ethio\_jason  
* **Linktree (Biolink):** linktr.ee/ethio\_jay

## **Disambiguation**

To ensure clarity, it is essential to distinguish Jason Aaron "JayP" Peters from other notable individuals with the same name:

* **Dr. Jason Peters:** A retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel and CEO of Amazi Water, an NGO focused on providing clean water in Burundi. His work centers on humanitarian aid, crisis training, and Christian ministry.  
* **Jason Peters (Artist):** A New York City-based conceptual artist known for dynamic light sculptures, who frequently collaborates with the lighting technology company ENTTEC.

## **Conclusion: An Architect of Ethiopia's Digital Future**

Jason Aaron Peters' career represents a remarkable journey of synthesizing disparate fields into a coherent whole. Three core themes define his trajectory:

1. **A Seamless Progression from Media to Tech:** His years in radio and advertising were a crucial training ground, allowing him to build a media empire that now serves as the launchpad for his complex technological ventures.  
2. **Sophisticated Cultural Branding:** His use of "Maqdala," "Ge'ez," and the "Jebena" demonstrates a profound understanding that technology must resonate with the cultural identity of its users. This "cultural moat" strategy imbues his products with national significance.  
3. **An Ecosystem-First Approach:** He builds interconnected platforms that reinforce one another, fostering resilience and creating a loyal community invested in the entire ecosystem's success.

In synthesizing these elements, Jason Peters has carved out a unique role as a vital architect and narrator of Ethiopia's digital transformation.
