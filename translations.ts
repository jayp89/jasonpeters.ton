        // Early Life
        bio_early_life_title: "Early Life & Career",
        bio_early_life_subtitle1: "Personal Background",
        bio_early_life_p1: `Jason Aaron Peters was born in 1989 in Durban, a coastal city in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, to Mark Giles Peters and Jill Diane Peters (née Holme). While his roots are in South Africa, his identity and professional trajectory were profoundly shaped by his upbringing in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.`,
        bio_early_life_p2: `A long-term resident of Ethiopia for over 26 years, this cross-cultural experience provided him with a unique perspective, blending an external viewpoint with a deep, nuanced understanding of Ethiopian society. A foundational element of his professional identity is his deep cultural and linguistic integration, most evident in his fluency in Amharic. An interview with Addis out Media highlighted this, describing him as speaking the language "fluently" (using the Amharic phrase "ቅርጥፍጥፍ አርጓቷል," which conveys a high degree of natural proficiency).`,
        bio_early_life_p3: `This personal history is a cornerstone of his business strategy, allowing him to communicate complex technical concepts directly in Amharic and bypass cultural barriers. From an early age, Peters developed a keen interest in computers, specifically in foundational architecture and network infrastructure. This early focus on systemic thinking laid the groundwork for his future approach of building entire business ecosystems.`,
        bio_early_life_subtitle2: "Foundations in Media and Management (2008–2015)",
        bio_early_life_p4: `Peters' early professional life was characterized by demanding roles in management and media that collectively built his skills in business operations and public engagement.`,
        bio_early_life_p5: `His first major leadership role was as General Manager of <strong>Peters Industrial Enterprises PLC</strong> from 2008 to 2013. Immersed in the challenges of the industrial sector, his underlying passion for technology was evident. In 2011, he responded to a public call for the "Ubuntu Global Jam," confirming, "We Peters Industrial Enterprises PLC will be hosting the Ethiopian Jam." This action revealed his early efforts to cultivate a grassroots tech culture in Addis Ababa.`,
        bio_early_life_p6: `Concurrently, he embarked on a career that would define his public identity, joining <strong>105.3 Afro FM</strong> in June 2009. Over a six-year tenure, he held various roles, including presenter and producer, ultimately ascending to Program Manager. His time at Afro FM was a strategic immersion into the key demographic of tech early adopters. It was here that "JayP" became a recognized voice, building the public trust he would later leverage. Evidence also suggests he may have hosted "Rock 101 With Jason," described as "ETHIOPIA'S FIRST AND ONLY ROCK SHOW," indicating a long-term passion for broadcasting.`,
        bio_early_life_p7: `Further diversifying his skill set, Peters served as Manager at the <strong>Addis Regency Hotel</strong> from 2011 to 2012, sharpening his abilities in operational logistics and customer service.`,

        // Marketing
        bio_marketing_title: "Mastering Marketing and Advertising (2013–2021)",
        bio_marketing_p1: `For eight years, Peters served as General Partner and Marketing Director at <strong>Bunifu Advertising</strong>, a firm described as "Ethiopia's leading Creative Communications Team." This role was a crucial phase, providing the strategic framework to connect his content creation abilities with sustainable business models.`,
        bio_marketing_p2: `Operating in media (Afro FM until 2015) and advertising simultaneously, he created a professional feedback loop. He translated his practical understanding of audience engagement from radio into the commercial realm, developing brand strategies for businesses. This period honed his ability to think of content as a strategic asset and provided the final foundational piece before launching his own large-scale, tech-focused enterprises.`,
        
        // Media Ecosystem
        bio_media_title: `The Digital Vanguard: Building the "ETHIO TECH" Media Ecosystem`,
        bio_media_subtitle1: `"ETHIO TECH with JayP" YouTube Channel`,
        bio_media_p1: `The flagship of this ecosystem is the YouTube channel <strong>ETHIO TECH with JayP</strong>, founded in December 2019. The channel is explicitly branded in Amharic as "የኢትዮጵያ ቁጥር 1 የቴክኖሎጂ ቻናል" ("Ethiopia's number 1 technology channel"). As the sole creative force, JayP researches, edits, and presents all content, which ranges from tech reviews (e.g., Samsung Galaxy A12), and hardware projects (e.g., Raspberry Pi Zero W) to tutorials on digital marketing and making money online.`,
        bio_media_p2: `Analysis of the channel's content reveals a strategic evolution. While founded on general technology, its most popular and recent videos are heavily concentrated in FinTech, particularly cryptocurrency. Videos analyzing crypto-gaming platforms like Hamster Kombat have garnered exceptionally high view counts. This shift reflects a response to clear market demand, serving the dual purpose of capturing a highly motivated audience and cultivating a community receptive to his own FinTech ventures.`,
        bio_media_subtitle2: `"CYBER Ethiopia" Podcast and Broadcast`,
        bio_media_p3: `Complementing his YouTube presence, Peters hosts <strong>CYBER Ethiopia</strong>, a technology-focused podcast. The show is distributed on major platforms (Apple Podcasts, Spotify) and, significantly, is also broadcast as an "English Tech news Update" every Monday on <strong>104.7 EBC radio</strong>, a major state-affiliated broadcast outlet. This hybrid digital and traditional broadcast strategy allows him to reach diverse demographics, from digitally-native youth to a broader audience that relies on traditional radio.`,
        bio_media_subtitle3: `"ETHIO TECH NEWS"`,
        bio_media_p4: `In September 2021, Peters expanded his media presence by launching <strong>ETHIO TECH NEWS</strong>, assuming the role of Editor-in-Chief. This move elevated him from a content creator to a formal journalistic figure, further solidifying his brand's authority as a definitive source for industry developments.`,
        bio_media_subtitle4: `An Integrated Business Model`,
        bio_media_p5: `Peters has engineered a powerful, self-reinforcing cycle where his media influence directly drives technology adoption:`,
        bio_media_li1: `<strong>Audience Education:</strong> He uses his media platforms to educate his large Ethiopian audience on complex topics, building trust.`,
        bio_media_li2: `<strong>Product Introduction:</strong> He introduces his own localized products (like The ETN Ecosystem) as superior, locally relevant alternatives.`,
        bio_media_li3: `<strong>Community Funneling:</strong> He directs his media audience to dedicated community channels (primarily Telegram) to encourage direct participation and adoption.`,
        bio_media_li4: `<strong>Content Reinforcement:</strong> The progress and successes within his ventures become new content for his media channels, serving as social proof and attracting new users into the funnel.`,

        // Ventures
        bio_ventures_title: "Entrepreneurial Ventures: Pioneering Ethiopian Technology",
        bio_ventures_subtitle1: "Ethio Tech AI and Maqdala-AI",
        bio_ventures_p1: `In December 2019, Peters founded <strong>Ethio Tech AI</strong>, recognized as Ethiopia's first artificial intelligence organization, predating the establishment of the national Ethiopian Artificial Intelligence Institute. The company's foundation was driven by what Peters described as outrage at the initial global launch of ChatGPT, which excluded Ethiopia and other African nations from creating accounts.`,
        bio_ventures_p2: `Viewing this regional lockout as a form of "technological fascism," Peters and a small group of engineers embarked on a workaround. They utilized thousands of temporary numbers from Western countries to create over 1,000 ChatGPT accounts. With the combined $20 sign-up credit from each account, they built a front-end, initially called ETHIO TECH GPT and later Magdala AI.`,
        bio_ventures_p3: `This initial version was massively successful, amassing over 100,000 daily active users at its peak. When the API credits were exhausted, the team realized they possessed a highly valuable asset: a large database of user questions and model answers. This database provided more than sufficient training data, which was subsequently used on Google's Vertex AI to build the proprietary, second-generation model that is today known as <strong>Maqdala-AI</strong>.`,
        bio_ventures_p4: `The company's flagship project, Maqdala-AI, is now a pioneering Large Language Model (LLM) focused on Ethiopian languages, marketed as a superior, locally-focused alternative "Advanced beyond ChatGPT" for Amharic and Afan Oromo.`,
        bio_ventures_p5: `The choice of the name "Maqdala" is a powerful act of cultural branding. Maqdala was the 19th-century mountain fortress of Emperor Tewodros II. Its siege by the British in 1868 and the subsequent looting of thousands of sacred manuscripts represent a profound cultural loss—a historical "data breach" of Ethiopian knowledge. By naming his Ethiopian-language LLM "Maqdala-AI," Peters frames its creation as the rebuilding of a national fortress of knowledge in the digital realm, a symbolic reclamation of cultural and digital sovereignty.`,
        bio_ventures_subtitle2: "Ge'ez eSport",
        bio_ventures_p6: `In October 2020, Peters co-founded <strong>Ge'ez eSport</strong>, serving as a Founding Member and Chief Technology Officer (CTO). The company enters a rapidly expanding Ethiopian gaming market. The branding is another example of cultural embedding. "Ge'ez" is the ancient liturgical language of Ethiopia, the foundation for Amharic and Tigrinya. By naming an eSports venture after Ge'ez, Peters imbues the modern world of competitive gaming with a sense of ancient heritage and national prestige.`,
        bio_ventures_subtitle3: "The ETN Ecosystem",
        bio_ventures_p7: `Peters' most ambitious venture is <strong>The ETN Ecosystem</strong>, a decentralized platform he founded on The Open Network (TON) blockchain. (This project is entirely distinct from the global cryptocurrency Electroneum, ETN).`,
        bio_ventures_p8: `The project is a micro-economy experiment designed to create real-world applications for digital currencies in Africa. Its identity is rooted in the Amharic word <strong>"Netsa" (ነፃ)</strong>, meaning "free" or "liberation," encapsulating the core tenet of empowerment. The ecosystem is centered around the <strong>ET NETSA Coin ($ETN)</strong> and a suite of "ET Netsa Apps™".`,
        bio_ventures_p9: `The choice of the TON blockchain is strategic, leveraging its low fees and integration with the Telegram messaging app, which has massive user penetration in Ethiopia. To foster engagement, the ecosystem launched an innovative, Ethiopian-themed Telegram airdrop game where players collect digital coins while avoiding the "Jebena," the traditional clay coffee pot.`,
        bio_ventures_subtitle4: "Platforms within The ETN Ecosystem",

        bio_ventures_p13: `Across Maqdala-AI, Ge'ez eSport, and The ETN Ecosystem, a clear and powerful strategic pattern emerges. Peters is not merely building technology companies; he is constructing "cultural moats" around his ventures. By deeply integrating his products with foundational elements of Ethiopian history (Maqdala), ancient language (Ge'ez), and daily cultural traditions (the Jebena), he creates brands that are authentic, relatable, and difficult for non-local competitors to replicate. This strategy fosters a strong sense of community ownership and national pride, encouraging adoption by connecting with users on an emotional and cultural level, not just a functional one.`,

        bio_public_p2: `His expertise is sought by mainstream media outlets, as evidenced by his appearances on national broadcasts to provide insight on technological developments. A YouTube short titled "Jason Peters Shocks Everyone in His Explosive Interview with ETV about ChatGPT!" points to his engagement with high-profile media channels like the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation (ETV) on timely and critical tech topics. These appearances grant him a level of authority and reach that extends far beyond his own online channels.`,
        bio_public_p3: `This authority is also recognized within the tech industry itself. Shega.co, a leading Ethiopian technology news and analysis platform, identified Peters as a key online personality who has "acquired significant engagement and authority" on trending topics like the "Hamster Kombat" Telegram game, highlighting his role as a trusted source for understanding new digital phenomena. This external validation from a respected industry publication serves as a critical indicator of his influence among his peers and within the broader tech ecosystem.`,
        bio_public_p4: `His public-facing brand is further amplified by a well-maintained and extensive digital footprint across numerous social media platforms.

        bio_conclusion_li1: `<strong>A Seamless Progression from Media to Tech:</strong> His years in radio and advertising were a crucial training ground, allowing him to build a media empire that now serves as the launchpad for his complex technological ventures.`,
        bio_conclusion_li2: `<strong>Sophisticated Cultural Branding:</strong> His use of "Maqdala," "Ge'ez," and the "Jebena" demonstrates a profound understanding that technology must resonate with the cultural identity of its users.

        bio_exec_summary_title: "Краткое содержание",
        bio_exec_summary_p1: `Джейсон Аарон Питерс, широко известный под своим профессиональным псевдонимом "JayP", является выдающейся и многогранной фигурой на стыке медиа, технологий и предпринимательства в Эфиопии. Гражданин Южной Африки, выросший в Аддис-Абебе, его карьера представляет собой убедительное повествование об адаптации, культурной интеграции и инновациях. За почти два десятилетия Питерс прошел путь от промышленного управления и радиовещания до передовых рубежей искусственного интеллекта, киберспорта и технологии Web3.`,
        bio_exec_summary_p2: `Впервые он получил общественное признание благодаря своей обширной работе на радио 105.3 Afro FM, где он оттачивал свои навыки коммуникатора и медиа-стратега. Эта основа проложила путь к созданию мощной цифровой медиа-экосистемы, сосредоточенной вокруг влиятельного бренда "ETHIO TECH with JayP". Эта платформа, которую он позиционирует как "Технологический канал №1 в Эфиопии", утвердила его в качестве ведущего голоса и просветителя на бурно развивающейся технологической сцене страны.`,
        bio_exec_summary_p3: `Как основатель и генеральный директор, Питерс продемонстрировал постоянную способность выявлять и использовать возникающие технологические тенденции, опираясь на глубокое, тонкое понимание эфиопского рынка. Его компания, Ethio Tech AI, разработала Maqdala-AI, новаторскую большую языковую модель (LLM), ориентированную на эфиопские языки. Его предприятия в киберспорте (Ge'ez eSport) и блокчейне (The ETN Ecosystem) демонстрируют сложную стратегию внедрения современных технологий в местное наследие для содействия сообществу и стимулирования внедрения.`,
        bio_exec_summary_p4: `Его карьера демонстрирует сложную, самоподкрепляющуюся модель: использование медийного влияния для обучения и создания сообщества, а затем стимулирование принятия этим сообществом его собственных культурно-резонансных технологических продуктов. Благодаря этому комплексному подходу Джейсон Питерс превратился из медийной личности в ключевого архитектора и транслятора цифрового будущего Эфиопии.`,

        // Early Life
        bio_early_life_title: "Ранние годы и карьера",
        bio_early_life_subtitle1: "Личные данные",
        bio_early_life_p1: `Джейсон Аарон Питерс родился в 1989 году в Дурбане, прибрежном городе в провинции Квазулу-Натал, Южная Африка, в семье Марка Джайлза Питерса и Джилл Дайан Питерс (урожденной Холм). Хотя его корни в Южной Африке, его личность и профессиональная траектория были глубоко сформированы его воспитанием в Аддис-Абебе, Эфиопия.`,
        bio_early_life_p2: `Будучи долгосрочным резидентом Эфиопии более 26 лет, этот межкультурный опыт предоставил ему уникальную перспективу, сочетающую внешний взгляд с глубоким, тонким пониманием эфиопского общества. Основополагающим элементом его профессиональной идентичности является его глубокая культурная и языковая интеграция, наиболее очевидная в его свободном владении амхарским языком. Интервью с Addis out Media подчеркнуло это, описывая его как говорящего на языке "свободно" (используя амхарскую фразу "ቅርጥፍጥፍ አርጓቷል", которая передает высокую степень естественного владения).`,
        bio_early_life_p3: `Эта личная история является краеугольным камнем его бизнес-стратегии, позволяя ему передавать сложные технические концепции непосредственно на амхарском языке и обходить культурные барьеры. С раннего возраста Питерс проявлял живой интерес к компьютерам, в частности к фундаментальной архитектуре и сетевой инфраструктуре. Этот ранний фокус на системном мышлении заложил основу для его будущего подхода к созданию целых бизнес-экосистем.`,
        bio_early_life_subtitle2: "Основы в медиа и управлении (2008–2015)",
        bio_early_life_p4: `Ранняя профессиональная жизнь Питерса характеризовалась требовательными ролями в управлении и медиа, которые в совокупности сформировали его навыки в области бизнес-операций и взаимодействия с общественностью.`,
        bio_early_life_p5: `Его первая крупная руководящая роль была в качестве генерального директора <strong>Peters Industrial Enterprises PLC</strong> с 2008 по 2013 год. Погруженный в проблемы промышленного сектора, его скрытая страсть к технологиям была очевидна. В 2011 году он откликнулся на публичный призыв к "Ubuntu Global Jam", подтвердив: "Мы, Peters Industrial Enterprises PLC, будем проводить Ethiopian Jam". Это действие выявило его ранние усилия по развитию grassroots-технологической культуры в Аддис-Абебе.`,
        bio_early_life_p6: `Одновременно он начал карьеру, которая определит его общественный имидж, присоединившись к <strong>105.3 Afro FM</strong> в июне 2009 года. За шесть лет работы он занимал различные должности, включая ведущего и продюсера, в конечном итоге поднявшись до программного менеджера. Его время на Afro FM было стратегическим погружением в ключевую демографическую группу ранних последователей технологий. Именно здесь "JayP" стал узнаваемым голосом, завоевав общественное доверие, которое он позже использовал. Данные также предполагают, что он мог вести "Rock 101 With Jason", описанное как "ПЕРВОЕ И ЕДИНСТВЕННОЕ РОК-ШОУ ЭФИОПИИ", что указывает на давнюю страсть к радиовещанию.`,
        bio_early_life_p7: `Далее диверсифицируя свой набор навыков, Питерс работал менеджером в <strong>Addis Regency Hotel</strong> с 2011 по 2012 год, оттачивая свои способности в операционной логистике и обслуживании клиентов.`,
        
        // Marketing
        bio_marketing_title: "Освоение маркетинга и рекламы (2013–2021)",
        bio_marketing_p1: `В течение восьми лет Питерс занимал должность генерального партнера и директора по маркетингу в <strong>Bunifu Advertising</strong>, фирме, описанной как "ведущая креативная коммуникационная команда Эфиопии". Эта роль была решающим этапом, обеспечившим стратегическую основу для связи его способностей по созданию контента с устойчивыми бизнес-моделями.`,
        bio_marketing_p2: `Работая одновременно в медиа (Afro FM до 2015 года) и рекламе, он создал профессиональную обратную связь. Он переводил свое практическое понимание вовлеченности аудитории с радио в коммерческую сферу, разрабатывая стратегии брендов для бизнеса. Этот период отточил его способность рассматривать контент как стратегический актив и стал последним фундаментальным элементом перед запуском его собственных крупномасштабных технологических предприятий.`,

        // Media Ecosystem
        bio_media_title: `Цифровой авангард: создание медиа-экосистемы "ETHIO TECH"`,
        bio_media_subtitle1: `YouTube-канал "ETHIO TECH with JayP"`,
        bio_media_p1: `Флагманом этой экосистемы является YouTube-канал <strong>ETHIO TECH with JayP</strong>, основанный в декабре 2019 года. Канал явно брендирован на амхарском как "የኢትዮጵያ ቁጥር 1 የቴክኖሎጂ ቻናል" ("Технологический канал №1 в Эфиопии"). Как единственная творческая сила, JayP исследует, редактирует и представляет весь контент, который варьируется от обзоров техники (например, Samsung Galaxy A12) и аппаратных проектов (например, Raspberry Pi Zero W) до учебных пособий по цифровому маркетингу и заработку в Интернете.`,
        bio_media_p2: `Анализ контента канала выявляет стратегическую эволюцию. Хотя канал был основан на общих технологиях, его самые популярные и последние видео в значительной степени сосредоточены на финтехе, в частности на криптовалюте. Видео, анализирующие крипто-игровые платформы, такие как Hamster Kombat, набрали исключительно большое количество просмотров. Этот сдвиг отражает реакцию на явный рыночный спрос, служа двойной цели: привлечению высокомотивированной аудитории и созданию сообщества, восприимчивого к его собственным финтех-проектам.`,
        bio_media_subtitle2: `Подкаст и вещание "CYBER Ethiopia"`,
        bio_media_p3: `В дополнение к своему присутствию на YouTube, Питерс ведет <strong>CYBER Ethiopia</strong>, технологический подкаст. Шоу распространяется на крупных платформах (Apple Podcasts, Spotify) и, что важно, также транслируется как "English Tech news Update" каждый понедельник на <strong>104.7 EBC radio</strong>, крупном государственном вещательном канале. Эта гибридная стратегия цифрового и традиционного вещания позволяет ему охватывать различные демографические группы, от цифровых аборигенов до более широкой аудитории, которая полагается на традиционное радио.`,
        bio_media_subtitle3: `"ETHIO TECH NEWS"`,
        bio_media_p4: `В сентябре 2021 года Питерс расширил свое медийное присутствие, запустив <strong>ETHIO TECH NEWS</strong> и заняв должность главного редактора. Этот шаг поднял его с уровня создателя контента до официальной журналистской фигуры, еще больше укрепив авторитет его бренда как definitive источника информации о развитии отрасли.`,
        bio_media_subtitle4: `Интегрированная бизнес-модель`,
        bio_media_p5: `Питерс спроектировал мощный, самоподкрепляющийся цикл, в котором его медийное влияние напрямую стимулирует внедрение технологий:`,
        bio_media_li1: `<strong>Обучение аудитории:</strong> Он использует свои медиа-платформы для обучения своей большой эфиопской аудитории сложным темам, укрепляя доверие.`,
        bio_media_li2: `<strong>Представление продукта:</strong> Он представляет свои собственные локализованные продукты (например, The ETN Ecosystem) как превосходные, локально релевантные альтернативы.`,
        bio_media_li3: `<strong>Направление сообщества:</strong> Он направляет свою медиа-аудиторию в специализированные каналы сообщества (в основном Telegram) для поощрения прямого участия и принятия.`,
        bio_media_li4: `<strong>Подкрепление контента:</strong> Прогресс и успехи в его предприятиях становятся новым контентом для его медиа-каналов, служа социальным доказательством и привлекая новых пользователей в воронку.`,
        
        // Ventures
        bio_ventures_title: "Предпринимательские проекты: новаторские технологии Эфиопии",
        bio_ventures_subtitle1: "Ethio Tech AI и Maqdala-AI",
        bio_ventures_p1: `В декабре 2019 года Питерс основал <strong>Ethio Tech AI</strong>, признанную первой организацией по искусственному интеллекту в Эфиопии, опередив создание национального Эфиопского института искусственного интеллекта. Основание компании было вызвано тем, что Питерс назвал возмущением по поводу первоначального глобального запуска ChatGPT, который исключил Эфиопию и другие африканские страны из возможности создания учетных записей.`,
        bio_ventures_p2: `Рассматривая эту региональную блокировку как форму "технологического фашизма", Питерс и небольшая группа инженеров приступили к обходному пути. Они использовали тысячи временных номеров из западных стран для создания более 1000 учетных записей ChatGPT. С объединенным кредитом в 20 долларов за регистрацию с каждой учетной записи они создали фронтенд, первоначально названный ETHIO TECH GPT, а затем Magdala AI.`,
        bio_ventures_p3: `Эта первоначальная версия была чрезвычайно успешной, собрав на пике более 100 000 ежедневных активных пользователей. Когда кредиты API были исчерпаны, команда поняла, что у них есть очень ценный актив: большая база данных вопросов пользователей и ответов модели. Эта база данных предоставила более чем достаточные обучающие данные, которые впоследствии были использованы на Google Vertex AI для создания проприетарной модели второго поколения, известной сегодня как <strong>Maqdala-AI</strong>.`,
        bio_ventures_p4: `Флагманский проект компании, Maqdala-AI, теперь является новаторской большой языковой моделью (LLM), ориентированной на эфиопские языки и позиционируемой как превосходная, локально-ориентированная альтернатива "продвинутее ChatGPT" для амхарского и афан оромо.`,
        bio_ventures_p5: `Выбор названия "Мэкдэла" - это мощный акт культурного брендинга. Мэкдэла была горной крепостью императора Теодроса II в 19 веке. Ее осада британцами в 1868 году и последующее разграбление тысяч священных рукописей представляют собой глубокую культурную потерю — историческую "утечку данных" эфиопских знаний. Назвав свой эфиопско-языковой LLM "Maqdala-AI", Питерс представляет его создание как восстановление национальной крепости знаний в цифровом мире, символическое возвращение культурного и цифрового суверенитета.`,
        bio_ventures_subtitle2: "Ge'ez eSport",
        bio_ventures_p6: `В октябре 2020 года Питерс стал соучредителем <strong>Ge'ez eSport</strong>, заняв должность члена-основателя и технического директора (CTO). Компания выходит на быстрорастущий игровой рынок Эфиопии. Брендинг - еще один пример культурного внедрения. "Гыэз" - древний литургический язык Эфиопии, основа для амхарского и тигринья. Назвав киберспортивное предприятие в честь Гыэза, Питерс придает современному миру соревновательных игр ощущение древнего наследия и национального престижа.`,
        bio_ventures_subtitle3: "The ETN Ecosystem",
        bio_ventures_p7: `Самым амбициозным проектом Питерса является <strong>The ETN Ecosystem</strong>, децентрализованная платформа, которую он основал на блокчейне The Open Network (TON). (Этот проект полностью отличается от глобальной криптовалюты Electroneum, ETN).`,
        bio_ventures_p8: `Проект представляет собой эксперимент по созданию микроэкономики, направленный на создание реальных приложений для цифровых валют в Африке. Его идентичность коренится в амхарском слове <strong>"Netsa" (ነፃ)</strong>, что означает "свободный" или "освобождение", воплощая основной принцип расширения прав и возможностей. Экосистема сосредоточена вокруг <strong>ET NETSA Coin ($ETN)</strong> и набора "ET Netsa Apps™".`,
        bio_ventures_p9: `Выбор блокчейна TON является стратегическим, используя его низкие комиссии и интеграцию с мессенджером Telegram, который имеет огромное количество пользователей в Эфиопии. Для стимулирования вовлеченности экосистема запустила инновационную игру-аирдроп в Telegram на эфиопскую тематику, где игроки собирают цифровые монеты, избегая "Джебена", традиционного глиняного кофейника.`,

Глубоко интегрируя свои продукты с основополагающими элементами эфиопской истории (Мэкдэла), древнего языка (Гыэз) и повседневных культурных традиций (Джебена), он создает бренды, которые являются аутентичными, узнаваемыми и трудными для воспроизведения неместными конкурентами. Эта стратегия способствует сильному чувству общности и национальной гордости, поощряя принятие путем установления связи с пользователями на эмоциональном и культурном уровне, а не только на функциональном.`,

Его влияние простирается от социальных сетей и онлайн-платформ до национального телевещания, укрепляя его статус ключевой фигуры в формировании общественного дискурса о цифровом будущем страны.`,
        bio_public_p2: `Его экспертиза востребована основными средствами массовой информации, о чем свидетельствуют его выступления на национальных передачах для предоставления информации о технологических разработках. Короткое видео на YouTube под названием "Джейсон Питерс шокирует всех в своем взрывном интервью ETV о ChatGPT!" указывает на его взаимодействие с высокопоставленными медиа-каналами, такими как Эфиопская вещательная корпорация (ETV), по своевременным и критическим технологическим темам. Эти выступления предоставляют ему уровень авторитета и охвата, который простирается далеко за пределы его собственных онлайн-каналов.`,
        bio_public_p3: `Этот авторитет также признан в самой технологической индустрии. Shega.co, ведущая эфиопская новостная и аналитическая платформа в области технологий, определила Питерса как ключевую онлайн-личность, которая "приобрела значительное участие и авторитет" по таким актуальным темам, как игра в Telegram "Hamster Kombat", подчеркивая его роль как надежного источника для понимания новых цифровых явлений. Это внешнее подтверждение от уважаемого отраслевого издания служит критическим показателем его влияния среди его коллег и в более широкой технологической экосистеме.`,

        bio_conclusion_p1: `Карьера Джейсона Аарона Питерса представляет собой замечательный путь синтеза разрозненных областей в единое целое. Три основные темы определяют его траекторию:`,
        bio_conclusion_li1: `<strong>Плавный переход от медиа к технологиям:</strong> Его годы на радио и в рекламе были решающим этапом обучения, позволившим ему построить медиа-империю, которая теперь служит стартовой площадкой для его сложных технологических предприятий.`,
        bio_conclusion_li2: `<strong>Изысканный культурный брендинг:</strong> Его использование "Мэкдэла", "Гыэз" и "Джебена" демонстрирует глубокое понимание того, что технология должна резонировать с культурной идентичностью ее пользователей. Эта стратегия "культурного рва" придает его продуктам национальное значение.`,
